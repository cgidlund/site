    <p class="project__p">This was an interactive commercial/campaign site for a Swedish tv show. The theme of the show was thrillerlike so of course the site should be a little scary too. The plot of the tv show was about a mathematician, so the site we built was a math game with scary easter eggs.</p>
    <p class="project__p">We used a lot of visual effects and sounds to get the right feeling when you played the game. To achieve that we used ambience background music and heartbeats that get more intense the longer you play. We also added randomly flashing images of scary people.</p>
    <p class="project__p">The site was built as a single page app in a game like environment. As it had a big number of levels for sound we used the sound API a lot through out the project. As the audience was targeted to be on the move, I put a lot of effort to built it for mobile first. The backend was build on Python for handling high score and share pages.</p>
