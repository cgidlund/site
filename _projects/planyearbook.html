    <p class="project__p">Me and an art director got the possibility to work very close together on a project for Plan Sweden. The project was about the digitalisation of their yearbook. As we had worked a lot with this client before, they gave us the possibility to present our own ideas. And fortunately they liked what we had created.</p>
    <p class="project__p">As this site just had a lot of data that would never be changed, we used a static site generator called Assemble. All the data comes from a json file that builds all the tables etc. In the 2016 version I had the opportunity to fine tune some of the code.</p>
