    <p class="project__p">Childmothers is a campaign site for a photo exhibition that travels through the world. It's purpose is to show children that became mothers at a very young age and tell their stories through photos, films, texts and sound.</p>
    <p class="project__p">We hade the opportunity to come up with our own ideas. So we developed a function for the site which works as an audio listening device. So when you are at the physical exhibition you can use the site to hear girls talk about the issues and see related material.</p>
    <p class="project__p">This project was built with the Jekyll framework as a static site, as it doesn’t have the need to be updated and they wanted to put the “focus” on the frontend. It also utilises the History API for page navigation for example.</p>
